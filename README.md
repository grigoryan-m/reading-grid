# Reading grid

This project is day #12 of <a href="https://github.com/grigoryan-m/31-javascript-projects">31-javascript-projects</a>!

Inspired by github grid.

You can set your daily goal (pages, chapters, etc.), but it doesn't really change anything.

All the information is stored in js cookies.

Press green button if you reached your daily goal and red if you didn't.

You can add a cell once a day.

If you don't add a cell for 365 days, grid will be deleted.
